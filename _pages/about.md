🎓 Way back in 2005, I wrapped up my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Software Engineering at NUI Maynooth. I then dived into a cool project on inertial sensors and stereo vision for my M.Eng at TUD, which I completed in 2007. 

🔬 Industry jam? For the past 15+ years, I've been all about R&D engineering in computer vision/deep learning and road testing technology. 

👨‍🏫 Teaching jam? Since 2020, I've been sharing my knowledge as a tenured Lecturer in Robotics and Automation at ATU Galway. My Topics? Machine vision and embedded programming for industrial 4.0 robotic and automation applications.

🎓🤖 I've started pursuing the journey for a PhD in 2021 at Technological University Dublin (TUD). My genral focus? Cameras of course! Initially in the area of Deep Learning and perception for autonomous mobile robotics!
🌱 I've particularly became fascinated in the topic of anomaly analysis in turfgrass environments ! This work is under projects here.
