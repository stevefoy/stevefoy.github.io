🎓 Way back in 2005, I wrapped up my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Software Engineering at NUI Maynooth. I then dived into a cool project on inertial sensors and stereo vision for my M.Eng at TUD, which I completed in 2007.

🔬 For the past 15+ years, I've been all about R&D in computer vision and navigation mapping sensors. Some of my career highlights include:

    Mapping and evaluating road pavements with a civil engineering consultancy.
    Working with top automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers at a major multinational company. There, I got my hands dirty with computer vision calibration algorithms, Visual SLAM, and Deep Learning for Advanced Driving Assistance Systems.

👨‍🏫 Since 2020, I've been sharing my knowledge as a Lecturer in Robotics and Automation at ATU Galway. My jam? Computer vision and embedded programming for industrial 4.0 robotic and automation applications.

🎓🤖 I've started pursuing the journey for PhD at TUD in 2021. My genral focus? Cameras of course! Initially in the area of Deep Learning and perception for autonomous mobile robotics!
🌱 I've particularly became fascinated in the topic of anomaly analysis in turfgrass environments !
